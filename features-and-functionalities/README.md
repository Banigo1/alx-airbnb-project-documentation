# Project Requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend

### üìö Introduction to Project Requirements
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements outlined below are categorized into Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements.

## üîë Core Functionalities
The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

## 1. User Management
### User Registration:
Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
### User Login and Authentication:
Implement login via email and password.
Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
### Profile Management:
Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

## 2. Property Listings Management
### Add Listings:
Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
### Edit/Delete Listings:
Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

## 3. Search and Filtering
Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:
Location
Price range
Number of guests
Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
Include pagination for large datasets.

## 4. Booking Management
### Booking Creation:
Guests can book a property for specified dates.
Prevent double bookings using date validation.

### Booking Cancellation:
Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
### Booking Status:
Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

## 5. Payment Integration
Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
Upfront payments by guests.
Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
Include support for multiple currencies.

## 6. Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Hosts can respond to reviews.
Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

## 7. Notifications System
Implement email and in-app notifications for:
Booking confirmations
Cancellations
Payment updates
8. Admin Dashboard
Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
Users
Listings
Bookings
Payments

# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
## 1. Database Management
Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Required tables:
Users (guests and hosts)
Properties
Bookings
Reviews
Payments

## 2. API Development
Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
GET (retrieve data)
POST (create data)
PUT/PATCH (update data)
DELETE (remove data)
Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

## 3. Authentication and Authorization
Use JWT for secure user sessions.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
Guests
Hosts
Admins

## 4. File Storage (Scenario based)
Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage

## 5. Third-Party Services
Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

## 6. Error Handling and Logging
Implement global error handling for APIs.

# üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Scalability
Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

## 2. Security
Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

## 3. Performance Optimization
Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

## 4. Testing
Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
